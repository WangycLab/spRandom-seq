# spRandom-seq

Current spatial transcriptomic methods have been widely used to resolve gene expression; however, these methods are limited to fresh or fresh-frozen samples due to low efficiency of oligo(dT) primers in degraded RNA samples. Here we have developed a spatial random-sequencing (spRandom-seq) technology for Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues by capturing full-length total RNAs with random primers, providing a powerful spatial platform for clinical FFPE specimens.
